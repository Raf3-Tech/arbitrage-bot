## 📌 Project Goal

Develop a Python-based arbitrage trading system that:
- Monitors price differences across selected centralized and decentralized exchanges.
- Utilizes flash loans (primarily from Aave) to borrow and execute profitable trades.
- Automatically detects, calculates, and executes cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities in real-time.
- Operates on BNB Chain and Polygon, with real-time price feeds from public APIs and websockets.
- Runs continuously from a cloud-based Linux server.

---

## 📍 Target Tokens

Include but are not limited to:

- USDT, USDC, ADA, SOL, CUSD, POL, XAUT, PYUSD, TON, XLM, XRP, RLUSD, BNB, WBNB
- Small-cap tokens with high volatility and liquidity

---

## 🔁 Exchanges to Monitor

- Centralized:
  - Binance (via `ccxt`)
  - Kraken Pro (via Kraken API)

- Decentralized:
  - Uniswap V3
  - PancakeSwap
  - SushiSwap
  - Aave (flash loan provider)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (3.10+)
- Solidity (for flash loan contract)
- `ccxt` – centralized exchange price data
- `web3.py` – blockchain interactions
- `etherscan`, `Moralis`, or native WebSocket feeds – for real-time DEX data
- `Docker` – for deployment
- Aave Protocol V3 (Polygon or BNB Chain)

## 🚀 Features to Implement

### ✅ Price Feed Engine
- Connect to Binance and Kraken via `ccxt`
- Connect to Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap via Web3
- Use websockets where available for real-time feeds

### ✅ Arbitrage Opportunity Detector
- Continuously scan price discrepancies across pairs
- Include adjustable profit threshold (e.g., ≥ 0.5% after gas/slippage)
- Add slippage tolerance configuration

### ✅ Flash Loan Smart Contract
- Written in Solidity
- Receives loan (e.g., USDC) → swaps on Exchange A → sells on Exchange B → repays Aave

### ✅ Trade Executor
- Python module to:
  - Estimate gas and slippage
  - Submit transaction
  - Monitor confirmation
  - Handle errors or reverts

### ✅ Logging & Monitoring
- Log:
  - Timestamp
  - Token pair
  - Price delta
  - Estimated profit
  - Transaction hash
- Alert via Telegram or email (optional)

### ✅ Gas & MEV Risk Management
- Estimate gas in real-time
- Include slippage protection
- Support private transaction broadcasting (e.g., Flashbots) later

## ⚙️ Configuration Example (`config.py`)

```python
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY = "your_private_key"
RPC_URL_POLYGON = "https://polygon-rpc.com"
RPC_URL_BNB = "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org"
AAVE_LENDING_POOL = "0x...."  # Polygon Aave pool address
TOKENS = ["USDT", "USDC", "BNB", "WBNB", "XRP"]
PROFIT_THRESHOLD = 0.005  # 0.5%
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE = 0.003  # 0.3%
